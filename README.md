# Blackjack

Blackjack - classic card game

* Players play against the dealer, not against each other.
* Players are dealt one face up card and one face down card. So is the dealer.
* Players may draw cards or declare to stay.
* Cards count as face value. Face cards are 10. Ace is 1 or 11 at player's choice.
* Hands that count over 21 are declared busted and the player loses (or ties if a player and dealer both bust).
* Dealer plays by rules - draw up to 16, stay at 17+.
